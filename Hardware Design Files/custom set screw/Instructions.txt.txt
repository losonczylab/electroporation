Materials:

	Glass-Filled Wear- and Chemical-Resistant PEEK 1/2" Diameter [1 foot]

Screw dimensions:

	Thread: 7/16-20
	Length: 1/2"

Instructions:

	Have a professional machine shop or use a tap and die set to machine the desired number
	of set screws. The precise specifications for the screw can be found in the CAD files.
	Machine shops will know how to work with this material. 

Purpose:

	Most manufactured 7/16-20 screws are made of steel or another conductive material. PEEK is a durable,
	insulating polymer that will prevent the attached electrode connected for picking up electrical noise.
